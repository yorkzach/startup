# Elevator Pitch:

In an age of cancel culture what you can say online is a shifting target that can be very hard to hit. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a tool that can analyze possible social media posts and see if the content would be received positively or poorly? TrendOn is a tool that keeps up with current trends, positive and negative and helps you to avoid the dangers of being cancelled.
